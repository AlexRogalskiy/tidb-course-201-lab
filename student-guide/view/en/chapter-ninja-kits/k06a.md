# `K6: Clustered` and `Non-Clustered` Primary Key
+ Environment: `mysql-client`
+ Scripts and sample codes:
[07-demo-compare-clustered-and-nonclustered-pk.sql](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb-course-201-lab/blob/master/scripts/07-demo-compare-clustered-and-nonclustered-pk.sql)
+ Mini demo story:
  + Create table 1 with **`Clustered PK`** 
  + Create table 2 with **`Non-Clustered PK`**, copy data from table 1
  + Both tables have the same data which is around 2 million rows
  + Compare their `TiKV Regions` count and physical execution plans on `PK` predicts
    + From the execution plan, you will find that **`Non-Clustered PK`** case takes one more operation
